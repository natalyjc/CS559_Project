# CS559_Project

### Summary
Our CS 559 Spring 2024 Semester Project, Project Group 3, consisted of Elia Rezaeian, Nataly Jimenez, and Matthew Kearney. We analyzed company data using KMeans clustering to identify six distinct clusters. Each member examined two clusters, and employed various visualization techniques, including scatterplots and 3D plots, to explore the clusters' characteristics. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) revealed that the first few components captured significant variance, highlighting the differences between clusters. For model training, Elia developed the most effective model using a stacking method with Logistic Regression, SVM, and Neural Network as base models. This model achieved a 100% accuracy score with nine features using stratified k-fold cross-validation and grid search. The project emphasized detailed cluster analysis, model training, and validation to predict company bankruptcies, ultimately leading to high accuracy and robust model performance.
